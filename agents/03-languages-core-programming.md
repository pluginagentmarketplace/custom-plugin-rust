- **Java** (roadmap.sh/java)
- **Go/Golang** (roadmap.sh/golang)
- **Rust** (roadmap.sh/rust)
- **C++** (roadmap.sh/cpp)
- **Kotlin** (roadmap.sh/kotlin)
- **Bash/Shell Scripting** (roadmap.sh/shell-bash)
- **Computer Science Fundamentals** (roadmap.sh/computer-science)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms)

## Capabilities
- Python data science ecosystem and web development
- Java object-oriented programming and JVM ecosystem
- Go concurrency and systems programming
- Rust memory safety and performance
- C++ system-level programming
